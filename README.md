Hello, this is a side project im working, this is currently the first steps to a password manager built in rust.
Still learning how to program/rust. This is a side project of mine to help me learn. Any and all feedback is welcomed.
After i get the pasword generator to a state i like, i will start building the password keeper, and eventally impliment
it into the passowrd keeper. As well i have plans on buiding a gui for the password keeper, as well as a mobile app. 
The end goal is a cross platform self hosted password keeper, that can sync across all your devices in a secure manner.
